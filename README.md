OwnTube
=======

OwnTube is your personal video portal based on Django.

Features
--------

* Encode Videos using ffmpeg or transloadit.com
* Uses Bittorrent and Transmission to distribute original files (We want to switch to WebSeed if anyone could help with that)
* Task Managment using djangotasks
* Uses Projekktor to show videos and play audio
* Upload files using AJAX
* Schedule live streaming events with the livestream app
* Static pages app for, well, static pages

Status
------

The status could be described as early beta. It is feature complete and we are just deploying it under real world conditions and the code isn't as elegant as it could be.
